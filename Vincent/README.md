4th year Polytech OpenGL course project.
In collaboration with @M3K0PZ and @LoricGallier

The goal of the project is to provide solutions for the modeling, rendering, animation and interaction of a volcano scene, with animated and/or interactive elements.

## Working features

- Terrain generation following a height map w/ working normals
- 2 skyboxes alternating in a day & night cycle
- Phong illumination model
- Normals vizualisation tool
- Fog effect

## Planned tasks

- Fix camera rotation behavior
- Create volcano height map.
- Rocks, plants & other models       
- Animating rocks and otters                          
- Clouds & smoke
- Particle system 
- Realistic water shader                                                                    
- Fluid animation (lava w/ perlin noise pattern)                         
- Control volcano explosion (& rewind) with keyboard
- Rewind system implementation
- lalalalalalala les optimisations j'entends riennnnn
- Shadow mapping                                                            
- Multitexturing                                                       
- Physically place the sun and associate it to a light source
- Profiling and monitoring system performance                         
- Grass and instancing system

## Bonus features

Mostly advanced lightning technics to do once everything else is done

- Screen space ambient occlusion
- Normal mapping
- Tesselation
- Parallax mapping
- Bloom, depth of field & lens flare
- Blinn-Phong shading
